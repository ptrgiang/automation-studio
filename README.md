### Professional Features

- Modern design with tree view action list
- Full menu bar and toolbar
- Enhanced multi-field dialogs
- Status bar with progress indicators
- Built-in Variable manager
- Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
- Double-click actions for details

## üîß Requirements

```
pyautogui==0.9.54
pillow==10.4.0
opencv-python==4.10.0.84
pytesseract==0.3.13
```

**Optional:**
- Tesseract OCR (not currently used but dependency installed)

## üí° Basic Usage

### Recording a Simulation

1. Launch the application.
2. Click action buttons to record steps.
3. For image-based actions, position the mouse and wait for the capture overlay.
4. Save the simulation to a JSON file.

### Playing Back

1. Load a simulation.
2. If your workflow uses batch variables (e.g., `{batch:column_name}`), go to **Edit > Manage Variables** to add your data. You can also import data from a CSV file.
3. Click the **Play** button.
4. The application will automatically detect if your workflow is a batch process and execute it accordingly.
5. During playback, a small popup will show the progress. You can press **P** to pause/resume or **S** to stop.

### Variable Substitution

Use the `{batch:column_name}` placeholder in "Type" and "Set Value" actions.

-   When you select a "Type" or "Set Value" action, the **Properties** panel will show a dropdown with all available column names from your batch data.
-   Selecting a column from the dropdown will insert the correct placeholder for you.
-   You can also type static values directly into the input fields.



## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **FAILSAFE** - Move mouse to corner to abort
- **ESC Key** - Stop simulation gracefully
- **Always on Top** - Keep control window accessible
- **Enable/Disable Steps** - Skip actions without deletion
- **Visual Feedback** - Status updates for all operations

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+O** - Open simulation
- **Ctrl+S** - Save simulation
- **Ctrl+Z** - Undo last action
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit application
- **ESC** - Stop simulation
- **Enter** - Submit dialog
- **ESC** - Cancel dialog

## üé® Customization

### Change Theme Colors

Edit `src/theme.py`:
```python
class ModernTheme:
    PRIMARY = "#2563eb"      # Your color
    SUCCESS = "#10b981"      # Your color
    # etc.
```

### Add Custom Actions

1. Define dataclass in `src/action_schema.py`
2. Add recorder method in `src/recorder.py`
3. Add executor method in `src/executor.py`
4. Wire up in main application

See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure running from project root
cd automation-studio
python automation_studio.py
```

### PyAutoGUI Issues
- Enable FAILSAFE (move mouse to corner)
- Increase wait times between actions
- Verify screen resolution matches recordings

### Image Recognition Fails
- Lower confidence threshold (0.7 instead of 0.9)
- Recapture template in current resolution
- Ensure target is visible on screen

## üìä Performance

- **Startup:** Instant
- **Recording:** Real-time, no lag
- **Playback:** Determined by wait times
- **File I/O:** Fast, JSON-based
- **UI:** Responsive, threaded execution

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a professional automation tool. When extending:
- Follow modular architecture
- Use type hints
- Document new features

- Respect separation of concerns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool automates interactions with desktop applications. Use responsibly:
- Test simulations thoroughly before batch operations
- Monitor first few executions
- Have fallback plans
- Don't rely solely on automation for critical operations
